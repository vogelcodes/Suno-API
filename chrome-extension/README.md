   - Click the download buttons to generate `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png`

## How It Works

2. **Track Listing**: Uses the Suno API to fetch all your tracks with pagination
3. **Download**: Uses Chrome's download API to save files to your Downloads folder

## File Structure

```
chrome-extension/
├── manifest.json       # Extension manifest
├── background.js      # Service worker for API calls
├── content.js         # Content script injected into suno.com
├── content.css        # Styles for injected UI
├── popup.html         # Extension popup UI

```

## Permissions

- **storage**: To save authentication tokens
- **downloads**: To download files
- **tabs**: To interact with suno.com tabs
- **scripting**: To inject content scripts
- **host_permissions**: Access to suno.com and API endpoints

## Notes

- Files are downloaded to your default Chrome Downloads folder
- Filenames follow the format: `workspace-trackname-trackid.extension`
- The extension automatically handles pagination to fetch all tracks from all workspaces
- Token is stored locally in Chrome storage
- WAV conversion requires additional API calls and polling
- Tracks are grouped by workspace with collapsible sections

## Troubleshooting

- **No tracks found**: Make sure you're logged into suno.com
- **Download fails**: Check that you have permission to download files
- **Token expired**: Visit suno.com again to refresh the token

## Development

To modify the extension:
1. Make changes to the files
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
4. Reload suno.com to test changes
